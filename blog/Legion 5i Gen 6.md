## So I Bought an $1600 Computer on an Impulse

And it's working fine. But more review and options to come. 

:::tip Test Checklist
I'd suggest checking out a few items that didn't really work propoerly on this legion 5i
- **Lenovo Vantage application**: always crashed upon opening. I had to reinstall it to get it working again. This issue is also documented on user support forum. Not sure what is causing it exactly. 
:::

So far it has been working well! Everything is silky smooth and functional. 

## Features To Test
I have been testing around but there's a few test cases i need to do before i'm completely satisfied

- Connect to an external monitor using HDMI cable.
- Connect to my Iphone and sync images with it.
- Play some HD game for an extended period of time

## My Test Cases

1. Coding
2. Using multiple Chrome tabs (actually I use Vivaldi - a very customizable Chrome)
3. 

## Pros

So far, everything is working fine and super fast! 

- Switching between multiple music video works faster compared to the sluggish speed on my Dell XPS 13.
- I can open multiple tabs on Vivaldi without experiencing delays or lags.
- Apps are super responsive upon sleeping and waking up. No more delays in interactions.
