## So I Bought an $1600 Computer on an Impulse

And it's working fine. But more review and options to come. 

:::tip Test Checklist
I'd suggest checking out a few items that didn't really work propoerly on this legion 5i
- **Lenovo Vantage application**: always crashed upon opening. I had to reinstall it to get it working again. This issue is also documented on user support forum. Not sure what is causing it exactly. 
:::

So far it has been working well! Everything is silky smooth and functional. 

## Features To Test
I have been testing around but there's a few test cases i need to do before i'm completely satisfied

- Connect to an external monitor using HDMI cable.
- Connect to my Iphone and sync images with it.
- Play some HD game for an extended period of time

## My Test Cases

1. Booting up React dev server. Initial startup is so much faster than my older Dell. 
2. Using multiple Chrome tabs (actually I use Vivaldi - a very customizable Chrome). It can handle over 20+ tabs just fine while my Dell already struggles with 5-10 tabs. 
3. Destiny 2 gameplay. Gameplay is smooth and no jittering frames. 
4. 

## Pros

So far, everything is working fine and super fast! 

- Switching between multiple music video works faster compared to the sluggish speed on my Dell XPS 13.
- I can open multiple tabs on Vivaldi without experiencing delays or lags.
- Apps are super responsive upon sleeping and waking up. No more delays in interactions. 
- Destiny 2 is booting up just fine. The gameplay is smooth as well. 

## Cons

That said, there are a few things I noticed while using the Legion 5i

- Fan noise is super loud. No need to go to the airport when I've got a mini airport simulation at home with kind of fan noise. 
- Laptop heat. Extended GPU usage will make the laptop hotter than usual. But it can't beat the magma-heat from my old Dell laptop.
- The Lenovo Vantage  froze everytime it was opened. But i managed to fix it by reinstalling the app. 


For my initial tests and usage, the Lenovo Legion 5i is doing much better than my older Dell XPS 13 already :)
