# Welcome to Notes

This website is built using Docusaurus - a React-based document builder and static site generator. 

## Reasons for Using This Tool

I have been using **React**, a Javascript-based library to help me build responsive and dynamic web apps. React library helps users create Single Page Applications (SPAs) that are quick and responsive at scale. Facebook created both the React library and the Docusaurus under open source policy. 

## Contents on This Site
Here, you will find miscellaneous notes and guides about various technologies, which I have been documenting for future reference and troubleshooting. I hope it can also be useful for wandering visitors on the web as well :)

## Clone This Site

You can view this website's source code on my [Github](https://github.com/fineon/heyian-doc/) account

### Prerequisites
You will need to install the following tools on your computer before starting:
1. git
2. nodejs
3. npm (usually coupled with nodejs)

### Downloading the Source Code and Building the Site
To clone this website, type in the following command in your powershell/ bash terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fineon/heyian-doc.git 
# navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd heyian-doc
# use npm to install all dependencies and start the local web server 
npm install 
npm start
```

Open your local site at `http://localhost:3000`.

Docusaurus can transform `.md` Markdown files into HTML to display as a web page. **This introduction page is written in a `.md` file!**
